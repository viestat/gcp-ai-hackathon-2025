# Adaptive AI Tutor

## Concept

A personalized AI tutor that builds, guides, and continuously adapts a learning roadmap for any topic — powered by autonomous, multimodal AI agents.
It doesn’t just teach — it learns how you learn, dynamically adjusting its methods, pace, and content format to optimize understanding.

## Core Agent Flow

    1. User Profiling (AI Interview)
    - The agent starts by interviewing the learner to understand goals, interests, and experience level (beginner → expert).
    - It builds a learning profile that defines tone, difficulty, and preferred learning style (visual, auditory, text-based, etc.).
    2. Knowledge Expansion
    - The agent performs a live web search to enrich its context about the chosen topic.
    - It filters, summarizes, and curates relevant information — building a foundation of up-to-date domain knowledge.
    3. Roadmap Generation
    - Creates a personalized learning roadmap, divided into stages or milestones (modules, checkpoints, and goals).
    - Each step includes tailored material and adaptive evaluation points.
    4. Dynamic Checkpoints
    - Based on interaction and progress, the agent injects adaptive checkpoints, including:
    - Text-based quizzes
    - Multimedia quizzes (images, sounds, or short clips, e.g., identifying visuals like nano banana)
    - Mini-projects or open-ended challenges
    5. Generative Learning Material
    - The tutor can generate teaching content in multiple formats:
    - Images for visual concepts
    - Audio for pronunciation, sound design, or auditory learners
    - Video for dynamic demonstrations
    - Text for explanations, summaries, and references
    6. Multimodal Evaluation
    - The agent can receive and analyze user-submitted content — text, images, audio, or video — to assess comprehension and creativity.
    - Example: a student explaining a concept via a short audio, or uploading an image of a handwritten diagram.
    7. Adaptive Feedback Loop
    - Based on the user’s performance and engagement, the system updates the roadmap in real time — reordering lessons, generating new examples, or switching modalities to better fit the learner’s progress.

## Why It’s Different

- Truly multimodal: teaches and evaluates using any medium — not just text.
- Autonomous & adaptive: it continually learns from user performance and feedback.
- Scalable & general-purpose: can be applied to any topic — from art history to quantum computing.
- Personal mentor experience: blends reasoning, generative content, and dynamic pacing like a real human tutor.
